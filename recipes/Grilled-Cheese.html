<p>This is the finest grilled cheese sandwich I've ever tasted, with a gooey Cheddar and bacon filling and a crunchy Parmesan crust! This, in terms of grilled cheese, is it!
Grilled cheese sandwiches are incredibly simple to make. The complete recipe may be seen below, but here's a quick summary of what to expect from it:
Mix the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and butter together. Place one piece of cheddar cheese and two slices of bacon on each sandwich. Apply the butter mixture evenly on every bread slice. Cook in a skillet until both sides are golden brown.
